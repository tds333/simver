Simple Versioning
=================

This is version 18.2 of the specification. (Versioning date based YY.M)

The idea is based on Semantic Versioning but simpler.
Or as an alternative on CalVer calendar based versioning.


Summary
-------

The normal version scheme for a release is the same as for
Semantic Versioning.
Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible
   manner, and
3. PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

Optionally there are to more version numbers:

4. BUILD
5. COUNT

A pre release (or development release)
is one with at least one version numer set to zero (0).

To compare releases split the version string by ".", convert the
every part to an integer and compare the resulting number tuple.
The numbers in the tuple are compared number by number from left
to right. 

To compare versions the version string is converted to a tuple
containing only integer.
For example::

    1.0.0 -> (1,0,0)
    1.0 -> (1,0)
    1.1.1.1 -> (1,1,1,1)
    2.4.5.6.7 -> (2,4,5,6,7)

Also simpler formats without a PATCH number is allowed.

As an alternative date based release numbers as 2017.1 or 17.1 are also
valid. Also something like YY.M.D like 17.3.1 for the release at the
date 2017/03/01 is also valid.
Only recommendation is to specify the exact release versioning scheme in the
documentation.


Simple rules:

- A version string has minimum one dot and up to four (1-4 ".")
- Only numbers >= 0.
- Pre-releases are indicated by having one version number set to zero (0).
- Comparison is done by splitting the version string in a tuple of numbers
  and comparing the tuples. If version numbers are equal the longer tuple
  wins.


Introduction
------------

The idea is base on Semantic Versioning and provides another solution to
handle versions in software projects and libraries.
It provides a simpler way to handle versioning and is also more flexible.

I call this system "Simple Versioning." Under this scheme, version numbers
and the way they change convey meaning about the underlying code and what has
been modified from one version to the next.


Simple Versioning Specification
-------------------------------

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

1. A simple version has as a minimum a major and a minor version number
(M.N) and up to major, minor, patch, build and count specifier
(M.N.P.B.C).

2. The most common scheme is M.N.P where M, N, and P are
non-negative integers, and MUST NOT contain leading zeros. M is the
major version, N is the minor version, and P is the patch version.
Each element MUST increase numerically. For instance: 1.9.1 -> 1.10.1 -> 1.11.1.
The API and feature garanties are the same as for Semantic Versioning 2.0.0.

3. Once a versioned package has been released, the contents of that version
MUST NOT be modified. Any modifications MUST be released as a new version.

4. Major version zero (0.N.P) is for initial development. Anything MAY change
at any time. The public API SHOULD NOT be considered stable.

5. A pre-release version is indicated by having one number set to zero.
Ex.: 1.0, 1.1.0, 1.0.1, 1.2.5.0

6. Precedence refers to how versions are compared to each other when ordered.
Precedence MUST be calculated by separating the version into parts, normally
major, minor, patch and build, count release numbers.
For comparison the version string is split up into a tuple and the numbers
are converted to a integers.
Precedence is determined by the first difference when
comparing each of these identifiers from left to right as follows: Major, minor,
patch, build, count are always compared numerically.
Example: 1.1.1 < 2.1.1 < 2.2.1 < 2.2.2.
If different version schemes are compared the comparison is done
number by number and if all are equal the longer scheme wins.
Ex. 2.4.5 < 2.4.5.0

7. If you don't need or want the API guarantees and another versioning scheme
as the promoted default Major.Minor.Patch fits better to your solutions, you
can do that. As example if you want to do year based versions with counting
the release number in the year, just do it. (2017.1, 2017.2, ...)
But name it only simple versioning compatible if it mets the specifications
of the numbering and the following definition.


Backusâ€“Naur Form Grammar for Simple Versions
--------------------------------------------

::

    <valid simple version> ::= <major> "." <minor>
                             | <major> "." <minor> "." <patch>
                             | <major> "." <minor> "." <patch> "." <build>
                             | <major> "." <minor> "." <patch> "." <build> "." <count>

    <major> ::= <numeric identifier>

    <minor> ::= <numeric identifier>

    <patch> ::= <numeric identifier>
    
    <build> ::= <numeric identifier>
   
    <count> ::= <numeric identifier>

    <numeric identifier> ::= "0"
                           | <positive digit>
                           | <positive digit> <digits>

    <digits> ::= <digit>
               | <digit> <digits>

    <digit> ::= "0"
              | <positive digit>

    <positive digit> ::= "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9"



Why Use Simple Versioning?
--------------------------

The basic idea is the same as for Semantic Versioning but eliminates
the complicated alphanumeric pre-release and build specifiers.
Only a zero number indicates something special.

For really simple projects it allows also to have simpler schemes and
omit parts. Also if someone wants to do date based releases it can be done
with this scheme.


FAQ
---

**What is the difference to Semantic versioning?**

It has simpler pre-release specifiers and allows also to omit the PATCH
number. You can see it as a refinement and simplification to Semantic versioning.

**How should I deal with revisions in the 0.y.z initial development phase?**

The simplest thing to do is start your initial development release at 0.1
and then increment the minor version for each subsequent release.

**How do I know when to release 1.1?**

If your software is being used in production, it should probably already be
1.1. If you have a stable API on which users have come to depend, you should
be 1.1. If you're worrying a lot about backwards compatibility, you should
probably already be 1.1.

**Doesn't this discourage rapid development and fast iteration?**

Major version zero is all about rapid development. If you're changing the API
every day you should either still be in version 0.N or on a separate
development branch working on the next major version.

**Does Simple Versioning have a size limit on the version string?**

No, but use good judgment. A 255 character version string is probably overkill,
for example. Also, specific systems may impose their own limits on the size of
the string.

**Is there a difference between a pre-release and development version?**

A development version is simply a pre-release.

**Is there a simple way to indicate a release version?**

Yes, if there is no pre zero number as version in it.

**Is it good practice to change release version schemes often?**

No, please decide a version scheme for your releases at start of your project
and don't change it then.
So if you decide with a two digits version scheme like 25.1 and not do
patch release, stick with it. 
For development it is fine to use an additional zero appended.

**Are simple digit versions allowed?**

No, the minimum is to have to number parts, ex: 1.1
A simple version with a single number, ex: 12 is not allowed.
This is to visually mark it with a "." that it is something about a version.


**I really want to have fancy pre-release or other build specifiers?**

Hmm, this is about Simple Versioning avoiding this kind of stuff.
So please use another version scheme that solves your needs.
All this complicated specifiers are against the main goal of the this
spec. But please think some minutes about it, your users and everyone else
will be happy if you choose the simple to understand solution.


**What is a development version?**

A development version is simply a convention. It is also a pre-release
specified with a zero.
For example use "1.1.0" as development version for the
release "1.2".



About
-----

The Simple Versioning specification is authored by Wolfgang Langner.
The main goal is to keep it simple also in implementation and for
version comparison.
It is simple to detect pre-release version.
It is clearly specified in every part.
It contains advice for the most common version scheme based on Semantic Versioning.
